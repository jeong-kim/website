## Regular Expressions (regex)
Regular expressions are used to search a string for matches of a specific pattern.  
They can be used to make finding information a lot easier, especially in large files. You can also use regex to search and replace operations to make changes across many files.  
Some other uses include parsing/replacing strings, reformatting/cleaning/stripping data, web scraping, and much more.  

The following is a regex sheet of common regex:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regex sheet", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("regexsheet.jpg")
```

re.match(r"expression",string) returns the first match in the string.
```{python}
import re
string1="hi my name is jeong"
match=re.match(r"hi.*is", string1)
match.group()
```

re.sub(pattern, repl, string) replaces matches with an expression.
```{python}
re.sub(r"my.* is","I'm",string1)
```

re.split() splits the string at the places where regex matches.
```{python}
re.split(r' ',string1)
```

re.findall() is used for multiple regex matches.
```{python}
